\f0\fs24 \cf0 When the PP site was re-launched it required a tool to enable easy navigation of the 80 or so items in its library. I came-up with a custom 3 panel browser enabling users to drill-down via categories to select what they wanted. Initially this was based on jquery and all the items were hard-coded into the html with the image thumbnail src attributes generated on the fly so as to reduce http requests and page load.\
	In response to the increasing difficulty of updating this as the number of documents swelled I developed a database driven design using PHP and MySQL with a jquery/AJAX front-end to exactly replicate functionality. I also built a login & back-end system to enable updating of item names, titles and even upload new thumbnails. Due to lack of support from the development team this was, unfortunately, never implemented.}
